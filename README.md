## Day 1: Introduction to AI for DevOps
### Topics Covered : 
- What is Traditional AI and GenAI ? 
- Usecases of AI in DevOps Engineering  
- What is LLM ? How LLMs are capable to generate the data 
- Prompt Engineering Basics

### Hands-on (Task): 
- Create a GitHub repository that contains a bash script. when executed the bash script confirms the health of a virtual machine by looking at the parameters such as cpu, disk space, memory. Please note that the bash script should also support a command line argument named "explain", when passed, "explain" provides the detailed summary of the health status.
